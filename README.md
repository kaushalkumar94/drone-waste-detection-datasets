A curated collection of open-source drone-shot datasets for garbage and waste detection using AI and computer vision.
#   Drone Waste Detection Datasets

Welcome to a curated collection of open-access drone-shot datasets focused on **waste detection**, **garbage classification**, **pollution monitoring**, and **environmental cleanup**. These datasets are suitable for building AI/ML solutions using computer vision models such as YOLO, Faster R-CNN, and more.
